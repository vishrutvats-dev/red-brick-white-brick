This React.js project depicts an interesting game to tap on the 3x3 grid cells and check the colored pattern.

**Steps:**
1. Initially, all cells are white.
2. Click on one random cell. It turns to red.
3. If any cell is already having red color, it reverts back to white.
4. It applies to each cell in the grid.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
